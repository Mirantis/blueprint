# Boundless - Tech Preview

The only ZeroOps Container Platform for Modern Apps. A collaborative ‘design and run’ platform for bespoke open source solutions.

## Using Boundless

Boundless is currently in tech preview. You are more than welcome to try it out, but please be aware things are still in flux.

Take a look at the [official documentation](https://mirantiscontainers.github.io/boundless/) for more information.

### Installing Boundless CLI

The installation process can be found [here](https://mirantiscontainers.github.io/boundless/docs/install/). Once `bctl` is installed on your system, it will be your main way of interacting with Boundless and take care of pulling the boundless image and setting up a cluster.

### Quick Start

The [quick start guide](https://mirantiscontainers.github.io/boundless/docs/getting-started/) will walk you through the process of creating a very basic cluster on your local machine.

### Example Blueprints

The [examples](https://mirantiscontainers.github.io/boundless/docs/examples/) section contains a number of examples that you can try out. Each example provides information on what the example does and how to run it. These are a great way to get started with a more complex cluster.

## Contributing to the docs

We appreciate anyone who is willing to contribute to the documentation. All changes will need to be reviewed before they are merged. As little as a typo fix or opening a ticket in the repo helps us out.

Changes can be made and viewed locally by following the instructions [here](website/README.md). This will show you how to run the documentation website locally and view changes as you make them.

Every page also contains a link to the source file in the top right corner. Clicking this will take you to the source file on GitHub where you can edit it. Once you have made your changes, you can create a pull request and we will review it.

## Additional Docs

If you are a Mirantis employee, there are additional docs that haven't been moved to the official docs in the [company wiki](https://mirantis.jira.com/wiki/spaces/BOP/overview).
