## Developer Guide
### Prerequisites
* Read and follow our [Code of Conduct](./CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md).

### Contributing to the docs

We appreciate anyone who is willing to contribute to the documentation. All changes will need to be reviewed before they are merged. As little as a typo fix or opening a ticket in the repo helps us out.

Changes can be made and viewed locally by following the instructions [here](website/README.md). This will show you how to run the documentation website locally and view changes as you make them.

Every page also contains a link to the source file in the top right corner. Clicking this will take you to the source file on GitHub where you can edit it. Once you have made your changes, you can create a pull request and we will review it.

### Submission Guidelines
Blueprint follows a lightweight Pull Request process. When submitting a PR, answer a few basic questions around the type of change and steps to test, and you are well on your way to a PR approval.

### Your First Blueprint Pull Request
Please Fork the project and create a branch to make your changes. Directly commit your changes to your branch and then, when ready to merge upstream, feel free to create a PR.

### Submitting PR
When you open a PR, there will be GitHub Actions that are run on your behalf. [GitHub Actions Config](./github/workflows/PR.yml)

Assuming everything passes in your branch, your PR is ready for review.
