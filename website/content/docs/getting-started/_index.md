This section contains information on how to bootstrap a minimal cluster with Boundless. Additional setups can be found in the [examples](../examples) section.

This basic cluster creates a k0s cluster on your local machine with the Boundless Operator and an example server installed on it.

Make sure you've installed Boundless before continuing. If you haven't, check out the [installation guide](../install).
