# Docs @ Blueprint

Welcome to the Blueprint Documentation repository.  This is the source for https://mirantis.github.io/blueprint/ .


We value your contribution! If you are interested, we invite you to check out the [Contributing Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and the [Code of Conduct](./CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md).

## Getting Started

To get started, here are three areas of interest:

### Installing Blueprint CLI
The installation process for Blueprint CLI can be found [here](https://mirantis.github.io/blueprint/docs/install/). Once `bctl` is installed on your system, it will be your main way of interacting with Blueprint and take care of pulling the Blueprint image and setting up a cluster.

### Quick Start
The [quick start guide](https://mirantis.github.io/blueprint/docs/getting-started/) will walk you through the process of creating a very basic cluster on your local machine. It's a great way to get started quickly and familiarize yourself with the basics.

### Example Blueprints 
The [examples](https://mirantis.github.io/blueprint/docs/examples/) section contains a number of examples that you can try out. Each example provides information on what the example does and how to run it. These are a great way to get started with a more complex cluster.

Feel free to explore these areas to kickstart your journey with Blueprint Documentation!
